# QBViz
> QB Viz Live Webapp

------------------

__TODO:__

- [x] Get it published

- [x] add Greg's EV data

- [x] Update Tableau Workbook - fix sizing

- [x] Add dynamic buttons to change filter selections

  - ~possibly colored buttons based on total QB EV~

- [] It's not mobile friendly bc of how I embedded the viz

- [] Could probably remove some of the extra scripts (MathJax & D3) if we don't need them
